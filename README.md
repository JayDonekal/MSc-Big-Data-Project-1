# APPLYING DATA ANALYTICS TO UNDERSTAND GLOBAL EMISSION PATTERNS

A research into evolving analytical model for predicting emission levels

The analysis report considers a leading problem of exploring the automotive emissions across geographies to discuss and apply the approaches recommended by leading trends in data analytics to real life challenges thereby aiding in deriving meaningful insights and inferences. We learn the potential of the model to be employed in delivering useful insights on data patterns leading to emerging trends in auto emission that may shape the environmental norms. We delve into the factors that influence the accuracy and completeness of such a model to translate data into a set of probabilistic occurrences
